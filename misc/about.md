Karthik rolls in molasses energy  
And charges up - no hippie poser, he.  
From techno-hedonism did he flee.  

Fed up with diagnosis of machines,  
He learnt of diagnosing men by means  
Spiritual, contextual, serene.  

You're awful sick? Your life seems worse than Hell?  
You long to hear the chiming temple bell?  
Take all that shit to Karthik. You'll get well.  

"Your lesser self will rise and float away;  
Your truer self will settle down and stay.  
You will be cured! Please join me as I pray."
