#### here's a quick bio:

i'm a guy from california who majored in computer science but didn't like it nearly as much as thinking about people

so now i'm studying ayurveda and spirituality to understand how i can best heal myself and others

this blog is the byproduct of whatever i've been thinking about. it's mainly to provoke a discussion with you, so send me your thoughts.

#### here's a long bio:
how i got into all this hippie shit:

i grew as a nihilist and a materialist, but not in a depressing way

it was like, "nothing matters, so i'm just going to fill my life with as much pleasure as possible, and i think that's fine as long as i'm also a good person"

in high school i decided i wanted to live an epicurian life. i wanted to live in a co-op with my friends in santa cruz or something.

you'd think that living in such a whimsical way would be spontaneous and carefree. it was like that, sometimes, but only on a small scale.

i did unhealthy shit to make memories or because it felt good in the moment, but on a larger scale, i was always ruminating and daydreaming and trying to optimize for the future.

it sounds incongruent but i don't think it is. i was just trying to spread the pleasure throughout my life optimally. the degenerate behavior, of course, wasn't getting me closer to my santa cruz co-op, but instant gratification was also part of my reward function, and i had to allocate for it.

i had a goal, the co-op, and a plan (get a high paying software job, quit ASAP, and move into my dream co-op, and have as much fun as possible achieving all of this), and like all good goal achievers, i tried to make every moment of my life fit in that goal.

and so the overarching theme of ages 14 to 21 became excessive thought.

"is going downtown on saturday worth it? how much pleasure will it give me? is it worth the hangover sunday? could i smoke weed to offset that? how much pleasure would that give me? how are my relationships doing? would they survive another flake or two? will not preparing for my interview this weekend affect my internship prospects (and thus my first job, and thus my immediate post-college earning potential, and thus my retirement age)? maybe i can do some vyvanse on monday, depending on how my stomach is doing."

that looks so ridiculous when i type it out, but that's literally how it was, except i didn't think the word 'pleasure' it was more 'lit' or 'fun' so i sounded less creepy and more like a normal person.

if i wasn't thinking about my own life i was thinking about life in general. "what makes a good relationship? what makes a good friendship? why do people crave validation?"

- didn't sit with myself and just KNOW the answer, would write about it and use all this conscious thought and logic to try and figure out the answer
- all the over-intellectualized philosophy classes i took didn't help either

anyway, as you can see, i was thinking WAY TOO MUCH and life became a difficult puzzle that i had to piece together rather than something natural and flowing.

i didn't think this was a problem though. i was great at optimizing, i achieved just what i wanted doing the minimal required effort, my parents seemed happy, i was having fun experiences, etc, etc.

unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, however, my worsening health forced me to re-assess my worldview.

you can read about this in detail here.

but the TL;DR is this:

i started off with a staunchly scientific mind. i believed the body was a machine where the inputs and outputs were chemicals and if you knew what chemicals to input you could heal yourself. i would take all kinds of vitamins and supplements and monitor my c-reactive protein levels and blood sugar. as i read more and more about this with little to no results, [i realized none of these scientists really know how the body works, it's all incredibly uncertain](trust grandmas).

looking for a guide, [i turned to traditional medicine](trust grandmas). reading research papers, i felt frustrated and distrustful at all the misdirection, fucked up incentive structures, and bullshitting in academia.  reading ancient scriptures, i felt resonant, illuminated, and trustful at all these sages with nothing to gain sharing this deep phenomelogical knowledge, none of which has been proven wrong over thousands of years.

and since traditional medicine does not see the body as a machine but as a more mystical entity with a physical component, an energetic component, and a spiritual component, i paid less attention to specific symptoms, 'IBS', 'fatigue', 'joint pain', and focused on living how humans are supposed to. 

we are not supposed to think this much. the mind is the root of all problems. and once i recognized this,  everything began to fall into place.

and i don't mean intellectually recognized as the west does with meditation.

 "download headspace and sit and don't think for 20 minutes because it relieves stress and boosts focus. it'll make you better at your job."
 
 but subconsciously recognized, like, "damn, everything is connected, my subconscious contains all the knowledge of the universe, thinking serves no purpose most of the time, all actions should come spontaneously out of the whole. live like a dog. dogs do not optimize, and they're always happy."
 
(TL;DR over)

and after all the teachings worked on me, i feel a deep recognition for the truths these sages speak, and i'm shocked about how wrong i was about the world just a few years ago.

i thought religion was for people too stupid to question their beliefs.

i thought claims not backed by research papers and confidence intervals should be immediately dismissed.

i trusted my doctor more than my culture.

the above beliefs are extremely common, especially among people my age.

which brings me to where i'm at right now. 

having been steeped in both world views....

* can empathize with both sides
* obviously i have beleifs that are more accurate / helpful than previous
* but i dont want to sell spirituality like my dad did
	- "WHEY PROTEIN IS BAD FOR YOU!!!"
	- "DON'T DRINK COLD WATER"
* explain why, in terms they can understand, appease the intellect first
*

i don't know if it's was karma or genetics or coincidence or terrible lifestyle choices but i've been plagued with chronic health problems since i was a kid.

i was tired all the time, my stomach was always fucked, i'd get sinus infections constantly, i couldn't sleep without some OTC cocktail of cough syrup, melatonin, and benadryl. 

i didn't really think anything of it. i was too busy thinking about my goals how to optimize for them. the health problems were just distractions i tried to ignore. 

and no one was telling me to worry about them either. during annual check-ups doctors would tell me my blood tests were fine and i'd tell them i was tired all the time and they'd tell me to eat healthy and exercise more and "you are young, don't worry about it". i was already eating healthy and excercising so i assumed that everyone felt tired and foggy and headached all the time, and i should stop bitching about it. i just needed more willpower.




- tired all the fucking time, "this is just how people live"
- first took health as an optimization problem
- even when i stopped drinking, stopped drugs, woke up early, excercised regularly, still felt like shit, and now also zombie-like since i wasn't having those fun memorable experiences that actually made me feel like a person
- excessive thinking CAUSED all that

i thought religion was for people too stupid to question their beliefs (lol).

and so these are the three 'kinds' of posts on this blog: 
1. over-intellectualizing life, creating ego-based narratives and hoping they generalize in some way
	1. e.g. this about page, nicaragua: comforts
2. writing about how to live naturally and spontaneously (i recognize the irony)
	1. e.g. monk stuff, awe
3. writing that actually arises from thoughtless spontaneity 
	1. e.g. it gets better, poem
	
and hopefully, one day, all new posts will be theme 3.
