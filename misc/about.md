#### here's a quick bio:

i'm a guy from california who majored in computer science but didn't like it nearly as much as thinking about people

so now i'm studying ayurveda and spirituality to understand how i can best heal myself and others

this blog is the byproduct of whatever i've been thinking about. it's mainly to provoke a discussion with you, so send me your thoughts.
