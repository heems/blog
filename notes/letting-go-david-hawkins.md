## My Experience

First of all, David Hawkins USES HIS OWN MUSCLE TESTING SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE HIS BOOKS STRENGTHEN YOU AND HIT DEEP AS YOU READ THEM, which is the coolest thing. He claims truth and positive emotions make you stronger, so he phrases his sentences to be as 'true' and as positive as possible by frequent muscle testing.

So, the ideas of surrender, the supramind, thought power, and mind-body-spirit connection were not new to me. They're fairly common, both from authentic spiritual teachers (Sri Aurobindo, Yogananda) and Instagram New Age gurus. But something about the word of this book makes your cells want to live the teaching.

I read Letting Go by David Hawkins at a dull time in my life. I was working a boring, absurd, passionless job. I was living in New York but I fell too sick to go out, party, and enjoy the city. 

All my mental energy went towards healing myself. I kept a detail log of every single herb, food, step, shit. I went to dozens of doctors trying all kinds of therapies. It was exhausting. 

Reading this book didn't cure me. I didn't experience a two week miracle like the ones in the book-- my process has taken much longer. But I did let go of the unnecessary mental burden that always accompanies suffering-seeking-a-remedy. 

Letting Go helped shift my orientation towards healing, from one of pouring over dry medical papers in my exhausted few hours after work, grasping for futile, opaque, uncertain solutions, to one of a pleasant and relaxed bumbling. 

*Yeah, I can't think, I can't eat, I can't sleep, but I'm still chugging along. The tension I feel only comes from wanting what I can't currently have, for reasons unkown to me. Wanting to look good when my face is pale from anemia. Wanting to think clearly when my breath constantly gets caught in my throat. Wanting to party when two beers will ruin my stomach for a week. If I just accept my pathetic state for what it is, it doesn't have to be pathetic. I can choose to treat my life with humor. To see my ego as a character and to root for him without worry, like a movie. To surrender. To stay attentive and open, expectantly waiting for God's outstretched hand to catch me. And finally fall backwards, with the trust that there will be a happy ending.*

## My highlights:

### Thought Power

“Thought is powerful because it has a high rate of vibration. A thought is actually a thing; it has an energy pattern. The more energy we give it, the more power it has to manifest itself physically. This is the paradox of much so-called health education. The paradoxical effect is that fearful thoughts are reinforced and given so much power that epidemics are actually created by the media (e.g., the swine flu). The fear-based “warnings” about health dangers actually set-up the mental environment in which the very thing that is feared will occur.”

(The sickly kids are kids are always germophobes. We assume it's because they fall sick easily so want to minimize their chances, but I'm starting to think, based on this book, others, and personal experiences, that it could work the other way.)

(It's been a year and a half since I've read this book. Back then, I would practice think positively, and feel a vague 'goodness' about it. But now, I'm much more sensitive to the manifestation of thoughts in my body, and am better equipped to verify the truth of new age-y statements about thought power. Just yesterday, the night brought a sore throat and congestion. Suffering from absurdly frequent sinus infections in the past, I knew what it'd progress into. But I stayed relaxed, and for five minutes just thought, "the sickness will leave me now, the body will push it out", and my body PHYSICALLY began to shake and tingle, especially my throat, just from the mental suggestion. I immediately felt much better, and for the rest of the night, I kept reminding myself of the same, and my body would respond similarly. I slept well and woke up completely fine. Swami Kriyananda discusses similar experiences of 'shaking off sickness' with thought.)

### Karma

"“In the uncommon case of persistent illness that is not cleared by the surrender of negative thoughts and feelings, unknown factors such as karmic proclivities may be operating. In such cases, we surrender the desire to change or control our experience of life, and we await further inner discovery about the source and significance of the illness. Surrender at great depth is complete when a person has let go of needing or wanting a physical healing to occur.”

### Inspiration

“Illustrative of this progression is the experience of an intelligent, successful, middle-aged, professional man who all his life had been unable to dance. He wanted to dance in the worst way, and several times during his life had attended dancing classes. But each time, he found himself to be stiff, awkward, and self-conscious. By sheer willpower, he did manage at times to go through the motions on the dance floor, but never enjoyed it and always felt ill at ease. His movements felt stiff and calculated, and the whole experience was lacking in satisfaction, doing nothing for his self-esteem.
After about a year of working with the mechanism of surrender, he was at a party with someone who kept insisting that he get up and dance. “You know I can’t dance,” he said. “Ah, come on and try it,” she entreated. She persisted and said, “Forget about your feet. Just watch me and do what my body does.” Reluctantly, he agreed, and he kept letting go of his feelings of resistance and anxiety.
On the dance floor he let go completely. In an instant, his inner feelings ascended the scale from apathy to love and, to joy, and even to ecstasy. His delight radiated to everyone. Friends stopped to watch. From a sate of high joy, he suddenly went into the experience of oneness with his dance partner....


All of a sudden, he remembered a previous lifetime in vivid detail. He had been a great dancer in that lifetime, and now he began to remember the specific instructions that had been given to him by his teachers in that lifetime. When he followed their instructions, the results were amazing! He discovered that there was a vertical gravitational center of balance within himself, and he began to rotate about it in perfect balance. The movement was effortless, and he became merely the witness of the dancing. It was no longer any feeling of “I.” There was just the joy and the dancing itself. Now he instantly understood the very basis of the Sufi dancing of the whirling dervishes. Their ability to whirl and spin without dizziness or fatigue—that certain state of consciousness—ensued from the surrendering of the individual self.”

### Curing Eyesight

"Driving home without glasses, vision was blurred. The pace was slow, with
headlights on the curb. There was an inner knowingness that we would always
see what we needed to see but unable to see what we wanted to see. During the
next six weeks, a great deal was observed and learned about what goes on
behind our everyday, ordinary seeing. There is a whole myriad of feelings,
varying from curiosity to competition to erotic interest to intellectual titillation.
Only about five percent of our vision is absolutely necessary to function in the
world.
A peculiar phenomenon occurred; only that which was necessary to see was
seen. Reading newspapers and magazines, watching television, or going to the
movies were all impossible. It became clear how most of vision is merely
escapism. On the road, it was as if Mr. Magoo were behind the wheel. Again and
again that same mysterious phenomenon would occur. As soon as it was vital to
see something, that’s when it would be seen. The edge of the cliff was made
visible just as it was necessary to see it. There was a great deal of anxiety, with a constant surrendering of fear. Finally, by the end of six weeks, the fear seemed
to run out. Instead, a deep surrender took place. “Well, I will only see that which
I am allowed to see.” The other emotional objectives which seeing had
subserved up to that time were willingly surrendered.
Then, a profound sense of inner stillness and peace occurred and a feeling of
oneness with whatever it is that runs the universe. And in that instant, suddenly,
vision returned totally and perfectly. What had not been visible or readable now
was crystal clear: street signs, fine print in dim light, objects in great detail
across the room and at great distance. At the next eye test for a driving license
renewal, the evaluator said that the vision was perfect and that glasses would no
longer be required. This had never occurred on any previous eye test!
Since telling this story around the country, quite a number of other people
have taken off their glasses and gone through the same experience. Interestingly
enough, each one said that it took about six weeks."

### Letting Go

“Problem solving using the mechanism of surrender can often be lightning quick with problems of long standing. To discover how fast it can work, let’s try it out. Take several problems of long standing and stop looking for the answers. Look to see what the underlying feeling is that produced the question in the first place. Once that feeling is let go, the answer will present itself automatically.”

### Relationships

“We recognize that people are not really responding to our body at all but to our inner attitudes, our energy state, and our level of awareness.”

### Health

“wheezing, a cough.” It is not possible, for example, to experience the thought, “I’m not getting enough air.” That is a fearful thought in the mind. It is a concept, a whole program called “asthma.” What is actually being experienced is a tension or a constriction in the throat or chest. The same principle goes for “ulcers” or any other disorder. We cannot feel “ulcers.” We feel a burning or piercing sensation. The word “ulcer” is a label and a program, and as soon as we use that word to label our experience, we identify ourselves with the whole “ulcer” program. Even the word “pain” is a program. In reality, we are feeling a specific body sensation. The process of self-healing goes more quickly when we let go of labeling or giving a name to the various physical sensations.”

“How about the experts? Their confusion is more sophisticated, wrapped in impressive jargon and elaborate mental construction. They have predetermined belief systems into which they try to squeeze you. It seems to work for a while and, then, it is just back to one’s original state again.”

“The energy of love has the capacity to heal our bodies when conditions are appropriate. On the physical level, because of the prevailing positive mental state, physical illnesses often resolve themselves. Some diseases automatically heal without any particular attention being paid to them, and those that still remain usually respond to consciousness techniques. Persistent illnesses that are unresponsive to treatment are viewed as karmically, symbolically, or spiritually significant. Overall, there is a decreasing awareness of the body, which now goes about its business and seems to take care of itself on its own. We are no longer identified as a body. There is a loss of interest in dealing with health matters on a purely physical level, and there are times when awareness of the body disappears altogether, unless we focus on it for some particular reason.”

### Healing Power of Laughter

“Norman Cousins, editor-in-chief of the Saturday Review for three decades, demonstrated this principle when he cured himself of serious physical illness by means of laughter. He wrote Anatomy of an Illness, a book about his experience of recovery from a crippling arthritic disease through heavy doses of Vitamin C and belly-laughter induced by films featuring the Marx brothers. He discovered that laughter had an anesthetic effect that could alleviate his pain for two hours. Laughing is a method of letting go. Through laughter, Cousins just kept letting go of the underlying emotional pressure and cancelling negative thoughts. This resulted in very positive and beneficial changes within his body and facilitated his eventual recovery.”


### Disease as a guide

“Sometimes it takes chronic sickness, suffering, pain, and a confrontation with the fear of death before a person is willing to let go of cherished beliefs and open up to the truth of clinical reality.”

(I've writtten about this here: [How Disease Shaped My Life For The Better](https://wheresmyenergy.com/2020/06/16/how-disease-shaped-my-life-for-the-better/))

### Consumerism and Modernity 

“People are desperate to stay unconscious. We observe how often people flick on the television set the minute they enter a room and then walk around in a dream-like state, constantly being programmed by the data poured into them. People are terrified of facing themselves. They dread even a moment of aloneness. Thus the constant frantic activities: the endless socializing, talking, texting, reading, music playing, working, traveling, sightseeing, shopping, overeating, gambling, movie-going, pill-taking, drug-using, and cocktail-partying.
Many of the foregoing mechanisms of escape are faulty, stressful, and ineffective. Each of them requires increasing amounts of energy in and of itself. Enormous amounts of energy are required to keep down the growing pressure of the suppressed and repressed feelings. There is a progressive loss of awareness and an arrest of growth. There is a loss of creativity, energy, and real interest in others. There is a halting of spiritual growth and eventually the development of physical and emotional illness, disease, aging, and premature death. The projection of these repressed feelings results in the social problems, disorders, and the increase of selfishness and callousness characteristic of our present society. Most of all, the effect is the inability to truly love and trust another person, which results in emotional isolation and self-hatred.”

### Hawkins Emotional Muscle Testing

"“The level of Courage (200) is the critical point that marks the shift from negative to positive energy. It is the energy of integrity, being truthful, empowerment, and having the capacity to cope. The levels of consciousness below Courage are destructive, whereas the levels above it are life-supportive. A simple muscle-test reveals the difference: negative stimuli (below 200) instantly weaken the muscle, and positive stimuli (above 200) instantly strengthen the muscle. True “power” strengthens; “force” weakens. Above the level of Courage, people seek us out because we give energy to them (“power”) and we have goodwill towards them. Below the level of Courage, people avoid us because we take energy from them (“force”) and we want to use them for our own material or emotional needs.”

### Supramind

“Intuitive understanding progressively replaces “thinkingness,” which begins to disappear. Over time, “thinkingness” and its mental processes are replaced by spontaneous, intuitive “knowingness.” Logic is bypassed. This occurs because, at the highest level of vibration, everything in the universe is connected with everything else. Our understanding unfolds as “revelation” from this inter-connected field. The knowing is holistic rather than limited.”

### First Time I've Seen "Emotional Goals" (all of my goals) Articulated

“Emotional goals are also glamorized by sentimentality and emotionalism. A certain excitement is projected onto the emotional event (e.g., a reunion, a first date, or being elected president of one’s class). It is made to seem more important than it really is in the overall course of events. After the event passes, life goes on the same and disappointment ensues.”

### Humor

“The unconscious mind is not polite. It thinks in gross concepts. When it thinks of the phrase “Murder the bum!,” the unconscious literally means that. Look deep within yourself the next time somebody cuts you off in traffic, and picture what you would really do to that person if you were strictly honest with yourself and did not censor the image coming to mind. You’d like to run them off the road, wouldn’t you? Pulverize them. Push them off the cliff. Isn’t that right? That’s the way the unconscious thinks.
The reason that a sense of humor is useful is because these images are comical once we look at them. There is nothing awful about it; it is just the way the unconscious handles images. It doesn’t mean that you are a rotten person or that you are potentially a criminal. It just means that you have gotten honest and faced how the human animal mind operates in this dimension. There is no point in getting melodramatic, self-critical, or tragic about it. The unconscious is crude and uncivilized. While your intellect went to prep school, your unconscious remained in the jungle where it is still swinging in the trees!”

### YMCA aphorism

“The fastest way to move from the bottom to the top is by telling the truth to ourselves and to others.”

### Connections

Nietzsche discusses Letting Go in Ecce Homo, albeit in a much more dramatic and tragic way:

“If anything at all must be adduced against being sick and being weak, it is that man’s really remedial instinct, his fighting instinct wears out. One cannot get rid of anything, one cannot get over anything, one cannot repel anything—everything hurts. Men and things obtrude too closely; experiences strike one too deeply; memory becomes a festering wound. Against all this the sick person has only one great remedy: I call it Russian fatalism, that fatalism without revolt which is exemplified by a Russian soldier who, finding a campaign too strenuous, finally lies down in the snow. No longer to accept anything at all, no longer to take anything, no longer to absorb anything—to cease reacting altogether. This fatalism is not always merely the courage to die; it can also preserve life under the most perilous conditions by reducing the metabolism, slowing it down, as a kind of will to hibernate.”
