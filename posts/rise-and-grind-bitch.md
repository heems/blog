My alarm goes off at four a.m. Alexa puts on Joe Rogan. I rise and repeat my daily affirmations.  

“I run a successful dropshipping teacher training. It generates twenty thousand dollars a month in profit. I have a hot Thai wife who loves to cook. My penis is ten inches in length, four in circumference.”  

I crack my fingers. Let's fucking go.  

Before I break into flow state my phone buzzes. FUCK. I forgot to turn off notifications. That's a nanogram of dopamine I'm never getting back. My whole morning routine derailed. And for what.  

“Happy birthday, Adam! Love mom.”  

I groan. More mental load. I should've gone off the grid, gotten a burner phone. I swipe the notification and add a task to my calendar: 'reply pleasantly to mom regarding birthday text'. I mark it as low pri and link it to the master task for this week: 'catch up on messages'.  

Back to work. I set up omnifocus to block every website besides Roam, Google Keep, Notion, Evernote, r/nofap, Pocket, Blinkist, Workflowy, Trello, TastyTrade, and Matt D'Avella's YouTube channel.  

Finally I sink into my task list. A frenzy of re-prioritizing, triaging, streamlining, retrospecting.  

First, I export my keep notes to drive for further organization. I check the task on Trello. Boom..  

Next, I make a networked map of my Evernote notes in Roam. I'm on a roll. I always make sure to invest in my notes apps. They're my second brain. The benefits will compound soon enough.  

I check the rest of my todo-list:  

“Review dropship item brainstorm and choose top three candidates for final ranking”  

“Finish howtomakemoneynow.co.uk SEO crash course”  

“Twenty minute cold shower”  

Overwhelming. But I'm up to it. “Twenty minute cold shower”. Let's go.  

I clap my hands together like a youth soccer coach. It echoes in the beige hotel room, the hollowed furniture resonating. I stand there aware of the thinning sound, a moment of absolute emptiness.  

I rip off my turtleneck. My body shudders in anticipation. I haven't felt warmth in two weeks. I maintain the thermostat at a strict fifty degrees. Warmth begets complacency. We must leave the womb to begin our quest.  

I pull off my boxers and flick the shower knob to the right. My shower curtain is an enormous portrait of Wim Hof shirtless in the snow. He looks at me with those brilliant eyes, and I look at him. I take it with me everywhere.  

As my big toe tests the icy stream, a shock runs up my inner thigh. My testicles retreat into my groin. My spine goes numb. My foot spasms as my animal instincts desperately pull back. But I am no animal.   

My vision begins to blur. I hear a voice in my head, “Don't do this to yourself. You can't take anymore.” I begin to falter.  

But then, another voice. A manlier voice: 

“You fucking pussy. Just do it.”  

I jump in. Everything goes black.  

~~~  

Lazy Sunday mornings. Unashamed yawning at eleven a.m.  

"Babe it's 11 a.m. we should get up"

"Mmm just five more minutes"

She hugs me like a koala and we sink back under the duvet giggling. Her body so warm with life pressed tight against mine, united against the chill fall air through the open window. Warmer, warmer, warmer, hot.

A little too hot actually. Almost suffocating. 

Fuck I'm actually suffocating. I can't breathe.  

~~~  

Chest tight I gasp awake. I'm laying on the floor of the tub. Frigid water pummels my numb shoulders. David Goggins shouts off a waterproof speaker.  

“GET OUT OF THE TUB YOU FRAGILE MOTHERFUCKER. IT'S BEEN THIRTY MINUTES.”  

My limbs feel prosthetic. My fingers have frozen together. I push myself over the edge of the tub, my whole arm working as one rigid unit, and pull myself out of the bathroom, by sliding on my belly. Still drenched, I use my flippers to squeeze on my exoficios and turtleneck.  

Another buzz. I scoop my phone towards me. Through teary distended eyes I can only make out:  

“Miss you”  

*Miss you*. My heart pumps harder.  

My hands tremble too much for the fingerprint sensor, so I expand the notification with my nose. I glimpse the full text.  

“Miss you honey, call me when you get the chance. Hope you're enjoying Mendocino. Don't work too hard. Love mom.”  

I hit my phone away with my arm like a pinball flipper.  

The warmth subsides into the hollow silence.  

My brain, still recovering, slowly processes the text. My own mom telling me to not work too hard? Don't work too hard? DON'T WORK TOO HARD? Does she want me to fail? Crabs in a fucking barrel. The warmth returns. I find my strength.  

2020 is the year of renewal. The year of new habits. New processes. New calendar apps.  

I must drop anything holding me back. Anything holding me back. Anything holding me under the duvet at eleven a.m. even though THEY KNOW I need to get up at six to start lifting. Anything begging me for five more minutes even though THEY KNOW I have to write seven-hundred and fifty words before breakfast. Anything rubbing their thumbs along the inside of my waistband even though THEY KNOW all greatness is borne of suffering.  

I claw my way back to my laptop and open Todoist.  

“Build Shopify websites. 3 sets of 5. 20 minute break in-between. Work the shipping muscle.”  

I stare, but the words won't register. My mouth hangs slightly. Possessed, my fingers move on their own, Ctrl-t Pornhub tab enter.  

An alert pops up.  

*This site is blocked! Do you want to take a break (Y/N)?*  

I stare blankly, my reflection staring back in the dimly lit OLED display.  

*Do you want to take a break?*  

Jesus. I jump for my phone with my frozen flippers. I ring the hotline. My focus app springs an alert.  

“ADAM, YOU HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT TO DONATE $1000 TO THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALISTS OF AMERICA EVERY TIME YOU USE YOUR PHONE DURING DEEP WORK HOURS OF 7 A.M. TO 11 P.M. ARE YOU SURE YOU WISH TO PROCEED?”  

I click yes. It stings, but this is an emergency. The free riders need the money anyway.  

The call connects.  

“Hello brother.”  

His voice is deep yet unnatural. I imagine him forcing his chin into his sternum for better posture.  

“I-i-i think I'm going insane– I almost just relapsed but thankfully I have the site blocked. I have a TWO-HUNDRED day streak, man. TWO HUNDRED. and I almost ruined it all. For WHAT? For what?”  

“Deep breaths brother. You did great. You're going to make it. Deep breaths–”  

“I can't. I *can't breathe.* I'm so *fucking* cold.”  

“Don't worry. The body just needs some time to adjust to the cold showers. The benefits really take about four - six weeks to kick–”  

“I'm so FUCKING cold I'm suffocating. Could I even jerk off if I wanted to? My arms are dead my fingers are frozen together, I haven't felt life in my dick in six months. What the FUCK is this? What am I doing? I spent ten hours researching blenders yesterday, *brother*. TEN HOURS RESEARCHING CHINESE BLENDERS. FOR WHAT? IS THIS THE REST OF MY LIFE? UPSELLING CHEAP FOREIGN BLENDERS ON SHOPIFY PAGES AND CLAMPING MY SEMEN DUCT? IS THIS VICTORY?”  

“Brother, please. You know not what you say. Remember how far you've come. Remember how late you used to wake up. How much time you'd waste under the duvet. Remember how shallow your work was. Always texting.”  

“THAT'S THE ONLY THING THAT–”  

“BROTHER, please stay calm. I'm calling in for backup. I'm sending a few comrades to your place with some bulletproof coffee and a Bruce Lee movie as we speak.”  

“THE ONLY THING THAT GIVES ME WARMTH IS HER BREATH ON MY NECK.”  

“Uh, come again?”  

“THE ONLY THING THAT GIVES ME WARMTH IS HER BREATH ON MY NECK”  

“Uh, just take deep breaths brother. Wait, what's that sound? Are you chewing? Brother it's outside the eight hour intermittent fasting window! Don't sin like this!”  

I wheeze and gasp as I shovel chocolate into my mouth. I down the cocktail of tears, mucus, and saliva and the blood returns to my fingers once again. My shoulders relax. My chest opens. Ambition fades.  

The alert still looms over my browser. *Do you want to take a break?*  

I see my dripping face set against the crude black and yellow webpage. I look surprisingly calm. Leveled, calculated. I slowly rise to close the blinds. I unzip my pants.  

The screams from the phone pass through my ears.  

“BROTHER, STOP. DON'T DO THIS. THINK OF THE REGRET, THINK OF THE SHAME. BROTHER, PLEASE.”  

I squirt Lubiderm into my quivering palms. Everything fades to black.
