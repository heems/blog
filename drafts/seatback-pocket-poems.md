For the first time in my life I flipped through one of those airplane magazines in the seatback pocket in front of you. 

Shit is dystopian. Satirical almost. I highly recommend it.

Here's a re-arrangement of the actual words in an ad.

## Gracious Luxury

when it comes time 

to build a second home

Canadian couple Karen and Blair, thought:

tropical

*very* tropical

and so they created a spectacular abode 

in the Konapali Golf Estates community

a gated community

supplying a peace of mind

4827 square feet

Italian porcelain throughout

and the quaint town, Lahaina

strolling through the shops.

ah, 

the convenience 

of nearby luxury restaurants.

Karen laughs.
