Season 4 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Season 1 > Season 3 > Season 5 >>>>>>>> Season 2  



It was just good overall, but Season 4 is easily the best thing I've seen ever.  



The rest though is just good.  I like Breaking Bad better overall.
Honestly McNulty and friends were really boring.  The best parts of the show involved gangsters or Carcetti and those guys.  One thing I thought was great about The Wire is that they always killed everyone's favorite character.  Like they would build up an extremely likable character (Wallace, D'Angelo, Omar, Bodie, etc...) and just kill them.  I also loved how there wasn't really a happy ending at all.  McNulty, Freamon, and Daniels get fucked for trying to be good police, Dukie becomes a heroine addict, and Marlo goes unpunished.  

:(  

After that chessboard scene in Season 1 where D'Angelo says pawns die quick and Bodie was like "Unless they some smart-ass pawns", I thought he would 
definitely be a major player by the end of the show.  Instead, he just dies a low level dealer.  Unexpected.
