After reading a few philosophy books, I am presenting myself with a P.H.D in armchair philosophy.  
Dr. Bala is now acquainted enough to name drop philosophers, books, and -isms in conversations and be generally pretentious but not knowledgable enough so that someone well versed in philosophy couldn't quickly realize I don't really know anything.  
  


Anyway with my new degree, I feel qualified to talk about the meaning of life.  
I think life is meaningless.
