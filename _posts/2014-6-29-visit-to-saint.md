Last summer, my parents took me to see Mata Amritanandamayi A.K.A Amma A.K.A The Hugging Saint.  

I initially didn't want to go.  My parents explained that Amma's hugs have a supernatural power to cure diseases, make you happy, etc and it sounded like a giant placebo.  This magical lady hugs you and suddenly you're filled with energy?  _I'm sure._  Despite my skepticism, my parents asserted that hugging her would change my life forever and I absolutely had to go.  

Pressured by my parent's cajoling, I reluctantly agreed.  

To my surprise, San Ramone's Amma Convention attracted a lot of white people; the kind of white people I could envision being damned by a conservative as "socialist, treehumping, freeloading hippy bastards".  I like this kind of person, however, and looked forward to hearing their beliefs.  Adhering to the "organic" vibe of the place, I spied a vegan coffee-shop and a stand selling vibrant accessories made of plastic beads.  After an hour and a half of waiting outside the convention center, and a few vanilla soy chai lattes made from organic beans harvested by fairly compensated migrant workers, we were called inside to see Amma.  

Not yet, actually.  First I had to listen to various heartfelt anecdotes vouching for Amma's superhuman kindness.  I'm not being sardonic here— the anecdotes really made Amma's kindness seem superhuman.  After the speeches, I had to endure an hour of meditation.  I try to meditate at home sometimes, but for like 15 minutes max.  My body was not ready for this much sitting in silence.  One thing I remember was that every time we said “oooooooohmmmmmmmmmmmm” the kid next to me would start his "ooooooooohhmmmmmm" during the middle of the crowd's “oooooooohmmmmmmm” so he could outlast everyone and flaunt his lungpower.  I thought that was pretty funny.  

After sitting uncomfortably until I was bored to the verge of death, we were handed cards by volunteers which basically told us when we could go up and be hugged by Amma.  As I squirmed around in my hard plastic folding chair watching those in front of us hug Amma, I noticed about 25% of people would walk away from Amma crying.  Were all those people really that deep into the placebo effect?  No, you can't just cry like that because of a placebo, can you?  Is she actually magical?  

As I pondered these questions, my family was finally called up.  I was the first.  Some assistants pushed me, surprisingly roughly, into a chair, and before I could register what was happening, nudged me into a hug with Amma.  The hug lasted about 10 seconds and she chanted something in a different language in my ear.  It ended, and as I looked into her eyes to thank her, I noticed the genuinely happy expression on her face, even after sitting there for hours hugging hundreds of people.  There is no doubt that Amma is a wonderful and selfless individual, yet as I walked away from the hug, I felt exactly the same.  No urge to cry.  No surge of energy.  No elation of mood.  Just a dull pain in my legs from sitting down for so long.  Maybe it's because I have people that love me, my parents.  I can see how someone not in my position might feel really good about that hug.  You would know that however terribly your relationships with your family or friends are going, Amma will love you unconditionally.  

My mom was one of the 25% that cried post-hug.  When I asked her later about why she cried and what she felt, she just said the hug made her emotional and she couldn't explain why.
Though I still don't believe Amma is magical and the hug didn't have an effect on me, she really is a saint and I can see how the hug might benefit certain people.
