A walkthrough of one of the worst articles I've ever read.  Author seems smart af, not trying to knock him.

"Why We Like People Who Share Our Taste In Music"

From the title, I think it's safe to make the assumption that the question of why we like people who share our taste in music will be answered.
Perhaps a scientific explanation will be provided for music being a predictor of similar personality traits, which has the corrollary of liking people with similar music tastes. Wow I'm excited!

"A study by Peter Rentfrow, and Sam Gosling published in Psychological Science in 2006 found that college students getting to know each other over the Internet are more likely to ask about music preferences than about all other categories of conversation topics combined. This research also found that knowing someone’s music preferences allowed students to do a reasonable job of predicting some of the new person’s personality characteristics and values. Personality characteristics are the basic dimensions of behavior along which people differ. Values are beliefs and goals that influence how people approach the world."

This sounds like something I would write.  There's no answer to the question, he just drops what we already know.

"On top of that, when we find out that someone shares our musical interests, that increases how much we like them."

There's def something fucky about this sentence.

"Unsurprisingly, people expressed that they liked a new person better when finding that they shared the same musical taste than when they did not. The amount that someone felt that they would like the new person was based strongly on how much they thought the new person would share similar values rather than similar personality characteristics."

"This research suggests that we often ask people about their musical preferences because musical taste serves as an easy indicator of whether we are likely to be similar to new people in ways that will influence how much we like them."

why tf else would we like them

"In the end, of course, we can’t know from this research whether music influences values or values influence the music people like (or both). That is, people may generally spend time with others who share their values. In these social settings, music is often shared, and the music you hear affects what music you like. So, sharing values could cause music preference.

But the opposite could also be true. Music expresses values. Lyrics have social messages. In this way, listening to particular musical styles could affect people’s values. But that is a topic for future research."

So I can't even conclude this????? are you fking with me
