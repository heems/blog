My Galaxy S6 randomly ceased to work at the start of the new year.  Since Sprint is shit, it took about a month of pestering for them to acknowledge that my phone crashed into a bootloop every few minutes.  

I see my phone as an extension of myself.  Google Keep augments my trash memory, Maps aids my awful sense of direction, enabling me to travel distances of over .3 miles without getting lost, and Yelp makes it acceptable to have pleb Java Chip Frapp sipping friends, as I can review the advice of hundreds of snooty Austin-based coffee conniseurs, discover a third wave coffee shop made entirely of exposed brick, and pretend to appreciate Ethiopian Yirgacheffe.  

Phones also increase effeciency.  When's the last time you saw someone actually use their wall calendar?  In the last decade, I haven't even seen one of those barbaric contraptions flipped to the correct month, most aren't even of the correct year.  What if you want to check your calendar when you're out?  Did old people just carry that shit around with them?  

I'm also anti-memory.  I think memorizing things is a waste of time.  I also have awful memory.  Einstein (allegedly) said "I never commit to memory anything that can easily be looked up in a book", and with mobile data, anything can be easily looked up.

So I was stunned that when I finally got the email from Sprint that Samsung had recognized a defect with my phone and my replacement was ready for pick up,  I didn't feel like picking it up.

### Pros of having no phone

#### The peace of a beepless life

It's been proven countless times that long stretches of uninterrupted thought increase mental performance on tasks.  I've read way too many useless self-help articles that regurgitate other useless self-help articles and entire stupid books on how I can double my IQ by maintaining a spotless sink or how smoking elephant shit can make me the next Elon Musk, but one of the only true spikes in productivity I've experienced was when I had no phone.  

Even if you aren't studying, phone beeps and buzzes jolt a wandering mind, dampening creativity.  If with friends, they cause aloofness.  Constant thought interruptions have been satirized since 1961 with the radios in *Harrison Bergeron* and more recently in the *Fifteen Million Merits* episode of *Black Mirror* with omnipresent TV walls designed to constantly block deep thought.  We seem to recognize this as dystopic, but then happily check our phones every two minutes.  Shit, I mindlessly refreshed my email three times while writing this paragraph.

Now you might be thinking, *why didn't you just silence your phone?* or *so I should just smash my phone on the ground every time I need to focus for a few hours* or *how long do I need to let the elephant shit dry before I pack the bowl?*  

#####  Why didn't you just silence your phone?

I always silence my phone when I study, and sometimes leave it in my backpack.  Maybe I'm just an addict, but every 5 or 10 minutes I'd always have that feeling that I needed to check my phone.  How often do you catch in a brief pause between thoughts, whip your phone out and mindlessly scroll through some stale social media feed, knowing very well that you've already read every new post, or opening and closing various apps with no real purpose.  It's not hard to resist, but the feeling is still distracting.  With no possibility of someone contacting you or a breaking news story/insane Facebook gossip or the fucking DuoLingo bird guilting you for not opening the app in four months, the distraction melts away.

You know that feeling when you've been camping for a while and your inner monologue quiets down in the face of the amazing world around you?  Like when it's been 3 days without hearing about school or work or The Bachelorette and there is nothing vapid to whip up mind?  Having no phone gives you this effect, just less pronounced.  

##### So I should just smash my phone on the ground every time I need to focus for a few hours?

If you can afford it.  If not, I'd recommend completely disconnecting for a week or two, since it really internalizes the importance of disconnecting at times.  You might start leaving your phone at home when you go to the library.

#### Less wasted time

You can't lay in bed mindlessly scrolling through reddit for the first hour of every day without a phone.  Boredom is a great motivator for getting out of bed or paying attention in class.  You no longer have an constant, insanely-low effort source of stimulation constantly available.

### Cons of having no phone

All that said, I still ended up getting a replacement phone.  Besides the obvious benefits (calling 911 in emergencies, google maps when lost, translation features, camera, music) there were a lot of subtle but important ones I never appreciated until they were gone.

#### Discourages spontaneity

I realized Google Maps and Yelp are essential to my random adventures.  I like to wander around a lot, sometimes for long distances.  With no phone, I'd  worry about getting lost or about walking too far into a place with no food.  You can't even call an Uber or taxi in a pinch.  You need to prepare more for excursions beforehand, which discourages spontaneity.  With a phone, you could decide on a whim to drive 7 hours to New Orleans and just go.  Without a phone, you'd need to plan your route, look up where you could stay, eat, etc, etc.

#### Paper is annoying  

I have my insurance card information on google drive, so I had to walk around the UT pharmacy with my laptop open looking stupid for an hour while as the pharmacists tried to fix some issue with my insurance information.  

I also use Google Keep a lot, and it's annoying taking out a piece of paper and a pen, finding a writable surface, and actually writing something down in my awful, unpracticed, handwriting in some definitely unergonomic, bent over position.

#### Everyone else has a phone

Discount apps only work on mobile.  My apartment complex couldn't reach me for two weeks since my phone number is the only medium of contact they use.  Society doesn't expect you to lack a phone.
