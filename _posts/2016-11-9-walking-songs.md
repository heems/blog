matching walks around Austin with songs
like walk around the Capitol listening to skeletons 
greenbelt 
dirty sixth listening to dark red 

I really enjoy wandering around while listening to music.  When I choose the 'right' song to match a mood or scene, I feel like I'm in an interactive 3-D music video.  While this post may become obsolute with VR music videos, here are my recommendations to re-create a similar experience.

## Dirty Sixth

To capture the chaos and slow downward spiral of thousands of drunk 20-somethings, I highly recommend "Dark Red" by Shlohmo.

## Capitol Building

"Skeletons" by JR JR will transform a beautiful sunny day at the Capitol into a vaguely nostalgic music video.
