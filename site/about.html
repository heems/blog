<h4>here's a quick bio:</h4>

<p>i'm a guy from california who majored in computer science but didn't like it nearly as much as thinking about people</p>

<p>so now i'm studying ayurveda and spirituality to understand how i can best heal myself and others</p>

<p>this blog is the byproduct of whatever i've been thinking about. it's mainly to provoke a discussion with you, so send me your thoughts.</p>

<h4>here's a long bio:</h4>

<p>i grew as a nihilist and a materialist, but not in a depressing way</p>

<p>it was like, "nothing matters, so i'm just going to fill my life with as much pleasure as possible, and i think that's fine as long as i'm also a good person"</p>

<p>in high school i decided i wanted to live an epicurian life. i wanted to live in a co-op with my friends in santa cruz or something.</p>

<p>you'd think that living in such a whimsical way would be spontaneous and carefree. it was like that, sometimes, but only on a small scale.</p>

<p>i did unhealthy shit to make memories or because it felt good in the moment, but on a larger scale, i was always ruminating and daydreaming and trying to optimize for the future.</p>

<p>it sounds incongruent but i don't think it is. i was just trying to spread the pleasure throughout my life optimally. the degenerate behavior, of course, wasn't getting me closer to my santa cruz co-op, but instant gratification was also part of my reward function, and i had to allocate for it.</p>

<p>i had a goal, the co-op, and a plan (get a high paying software job, quit ASAP, and move into my dream co-op, and have as much fun as possible achieving all of this), and like all good goal achievers, i tried to make every moment of my life fit in that goal.</p>

<p>and so the overarching theme of ages 14 to 21 became excessive thought.</p>

<p>"is going downtown on saturday worth it? how much pleasure will it give me? is it worth the hangover sunday? could i smoke weed to offset that? how much pleasure would that give me? how are my relationships doing? would they survive another flake or two? will not preparing for my interview this weekend affect my internship prospects (and thus my first job, and thus my immediate post-college earning potential, and thus my retirement age)? maybe i can do some vyvanse on monday, depending on how my stomach is doing."</p>

<p>that looks so ridiculous when i type it out, but that's literally how it was, except i didn't think the word 'pleasure' it was more 'lit' or 'fun' so i sounded less creepy and more like a normal person.</p>

<p>if i wasn't thinking about my own life i was thinking about life in general. "what makes a good relationship? what makes a good friendship? why do i like coming of age movies so much? why do people crave validation?"</p>

<ul>
<li>didn't sit with myself and just KNOW the answer, would write about it and use all this conscious thought and logic to try and figure out the answer</li>
<li>all the over-intellectualized philosophy classes i took didn't help either</li>
</ul>

<p>anyway, as you can see, i was thinking WAY TOO MUCH and life became a difficult puzzle that i had to piece together rather than something natural and flowing.</p>

<p>i didn't think this was a problem though. i was great at optmizing, i achieved just what i wanted doing the minimal required effort, my parents seemed happy, i was having fun experiences, etc, etc.</p>

<p>unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, however, my worsening health forced me to re-assess my worldview.</p>

<ul>
<li>tired all the fucking time, "this is just how people live"</li>
<li>first took health as an optimization problem</li>
<li>even when i stopped drinking, stopped drugs, woke up early, excercised regularly, still felt like shit, and now also zombie-like since i wasn't having those fun memorable experiences that actually made me feel like a person</li>
<li>excessive thinking CAUSED all that</li>
</ul>

<p>i thought religion was for people too stupid to question their beliefs (lol).</p>
